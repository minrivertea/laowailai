Hey {{ name }},

Thanks for signing up, and welcome to LaoWaiLai.com, a site just for Fuzhou foreigners!

You can post anything on the site - if you want to try it out, how about telling us:

 - Your favourite place to go in Fuzhou?
 - A website you like about Fuzhou?
 - Who you are and what you're doing here?
 
Post your information here - http://www.laowailai.com/posts/add
 
Every week, we'll be sending information posted by other Fuzhou foreigners direct to your inbox at {{ email_address }} - news, events, hints and tips to help you get the most out of the city (or to help you stay in touch if you've already left!)

If you want to unsubscribe from weekly emails, you can do so at any time by visiting http://www.laowailai.com/unsubscribe/

I look forward to meeting you soon!


Best regards,
Chris (LaoWaiLai Founder)
